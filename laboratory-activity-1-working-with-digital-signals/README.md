# Laboratory Activity #1  
## Working with Digital Signals

### Course
**COSC 111 – Internet of Things**

## Description
In this laboratory activity, digital signals were explored through hands-on experimentation using an Arduino microcontroller. The activity demonstrates how digital signals operate using binary states (`HIGH` and `LOW`), signal transitions, and timing control.

By controlling multiple LEDs connected to digital pins, the activity illustrates how digital outputs behave in real-world electronic systems. This reinforces foundational concepts such as:
- Binary logic
- Digital signal transitions
- Output pin configuration
- Timing and sequencing in digital systems

These concepts are critical for understanding how sensors, actuators, and controllers interact in IoT environments.

## Activity Overview
The Arduino program:
- Configures multiple digital pins as outputs
- Turns LEDs **ON sequentially** with a fixed delay
- Turns LEDs **OFF sequentially** with the same delay
- Repeats the process continuously using the `loop()` function

This creates a visible representation of digital signal changes over time.
